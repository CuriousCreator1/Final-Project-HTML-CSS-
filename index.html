                <p>For my website I wanted to display that I can work well with people by providing Board
                    games that someone and I have created together.

                <p>For this section I wanted to display that I can create an entire game from start to finish, as well as
                    having it being well polished.

                <p>This is just to show that I can not only program well, but that I'm also capable of doing art in all forms
                    such as 2D and 3D art and animation.
